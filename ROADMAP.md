Future enhancements:

M1:
- Feedback link
- Endpoint to expose Docker API
- When you set expected agent state offline, all endpoints expected states go offline so you have to turn them back on one by one

M2:
- with agent failing (before heartbeat failure), stop endpoint. the UI gets stuck until agent fails
- Starting an endpoint while the internet is offline goes failed instead of connecting
- Traffic Inspector icon in the list view
- show badges for pooling / binding
- Link directly to the correct endpoint page on the ngrok dashboard (require ngrok-go update)
- Advanced options doesnâ€™t scroll to let you know there are options that appear underneath
- port detection when 
- more comprehensive tests
